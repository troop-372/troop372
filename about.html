        <h3 class="size8">Teaching Life Skills</h3>
        <p>Scouting is a values-based program with its own code of conduct. The Scout Oath and Law help instill the values of good conduct and honesty. A boy who spends one year in a Scout troop will learn lifetime skills. He will learn basic outdoor skills, first aid, citizenship training, leadership skills, self-reliance, and how to get along with others. Scouting will prepare him to live a more productive and fulfilling life</p>

        <h3 class="size8">Methods of Scouting</h3>
        <p><strong>The Ideals - </strong>The ideals of the Boy Scouts of America are spelled out in the Scout Oath, Law, Motto, and Slogan.<br><br><strong>The Patrol Method - </strong>Made up of boys who are close in age and experience level, each patrol helps its members develop a sense of pride and identity.<br><br><strong>The Outdoors - </strong>Most of Troop 372&rsquo;s activities are designed to take place outdoors where boys can find real adventure. Our schedule can be viewed on the Troop Calendar page.<br><br><strong>Advancement - </strong>As one of eight methods of Scouting, advancement is a natural outcome of the other seven. A scout who is active in the Troop 372 program will almost certainly find himself advancing along the trail to Eagle Scout.<br><br><strong>Association with Adults - </strong>Boys learn a great deal from watching how adults conduct themselves. Scout leaders are positive role models for the members of the Troop.<br><br><strong>Personal Growth -</strong> Scouting age boys are experiencing dramatic physical and emotional growth. Scouting offers them opportunities to channel their energy into productive endeavors and find answers they are seeking to many of their questions.<br><br><strong>Leadership Development -</strong> Troop 372 is a boy led unit. Through leadership experiences, boys learn planning, organization and decision making.<br><br><strong>The Uniform -</strong> Wearing the uniform develops a sense of belonging to the patrol and troop. The Troop 372 uniform policy is discussed in the New Parent Handbook.</p>
